makefile uses FC=gfortran and CC=gcc.
Many compiler flags are commented out in an effort of finding what
compiles on "every" machine I could find.  The most common denominator.

As of 2010, tape I/O probably will not work on non Sun computers 
    (mtio.h and other issues)

Make sure to use compatible versions of gcc and gfortran.
(At IGPP, there are two gccs, so the one used to compile gfortran must be used).


OSX:
X86_64 machines may have to use CFLAGS = -m32
CFLAGS = -O2 and other CFLAGS may be turned on.


Linux:
Older Redhat systems may have to use FC=f77 or FC=/usr/bin/f77
gcc  -m32 does not work with gfortran on gcc version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-46)
gcc   -O and -02 do not work under gcc version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-46)


Suns:
FC=f77 
CC=cc
Remember to use gmake rather than Sun's make.
In make.sioseis use  magsun.o rather than  magmacosx.o
