      SUBROUTINE ASCEBC( STRIN, NCHARS, STROUT )
C    ASCEBC CONVERTS ASCII CHARACTERS TO EBCDIC CHARACTERS.
C    UNKNOWN CHARACTERS ARE CONVERTED INTO QUESTION MARKS.
C
C  ARGUMENTS:
C     STRIN  - THE STRING OF CHARACTERS TO BE CONVERTED.  STRIN must be type
c              CHARACTER
C     NCHARS - THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS TO CONVERT.
C     STROUT - THE OUTPUT STRING OF CHARACTERS. ISTROU MAY BE THE SAME AS
